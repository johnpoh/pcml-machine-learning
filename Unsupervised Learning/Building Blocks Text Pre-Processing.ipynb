    "\n",
    "In the last article of our series, we introduced the concept of Natural Language Processing, you can read it here, and now you probably want to try it yourself, right? Great! Without further ado, let's dive in to the building blocks for statistical natural language processing. \n",

    "### Text Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing the text means converting it to a more convenient, standard form before performing turning it to features for higher level modeling. Think of this step as converting human readable language into a form that is machine readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard framework to normalize the text includes:\n",
    "1. Tokenization\n",
    "2. Stop Words Removal\n",
    "3. Morphological Normalization\n",
    "4. Collocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing consists of a number of steps, any number of which may or not apply to a given task. More generally, in this article we'll discuss some predetermined body of text, and perform some basic transformative analysis that can be used for performing further, more meaningful natural language processing\n",
    "\n",
    "** **\n",
    "#### Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a character sequence and a defined document unit (blurb of texts), tokenization is the task of chopping it up into pieces, called tokens, perhaps at the same time throwing away certain characters/words, such as punctuation. Ordinarily, there are two types of tokenization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Word Tokenization: Used to separate words via unique space character. Depending on the application, word tokenization may also tokenize multi-word expressions like New York. This is often times is closely tied to a process called Named Entity Recognition. Later in this tutorial, we will look at Collocation (Phrase) Modeling that helps address part of this challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sentence Tokenization/Segmentation: Along with word tokenization, sentence segmentation is a crucial step in text processing. This is usually performed based on punctuations such as \".\", \"?\", \"!\" as they tend to mark the sentence boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "- The use of abbreviations may prompt the tokenizer to detect a sentence boundary where there is none. \n",
    "- Numbers, special characters, hyphenation, and capitalization. In the expressions \"don't,\" \"I'd,\" \"John's\" do we have one, two or three tokens?"

    "#### Stop Words Removal\n",
    "Often, there are a few ubiquitous words which would appear to be of little value in helping the purpose of analysis but increases the dimensionality of feature set, are excluded from the vocabulary entirely as the part of stop words removal process. There are two considerations usually that motivate this removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Irrelevance: Allows one to analyze only on content-bearing words. Stopwords, also called empty words because they generally do not bear much meaning, introduce noise in the analysis/modeling process\n",
    "2. Dimension: Removing the stopwords also allows one to reduce the tokens in documents significantly, and thereby decreasing feature dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting all characters into lowercase letters before stopwords removal process can introduce ambiguity in the text, and sometimes entirely changing the meaning of it. For example, with the expressions \"US citizen\" will be viewed as \"us citizen\" or \"IT scientist\" as \"it scientist\". Since both *us* and *it* are normally considered stop words, it would result in an inaccurate outcome. The strategy regarding the treatment of stopwords can thus be refined by identifying that \"US\" and \"IT\" are not pronouns in the above examples, through a part-of-speech tagging step."

    "1. Stemming: The procedure aims to identify the stem of a word and use it in lieu of the word itself.

The entire algorithm is too long and intricate to present here, but you can find details here\n",
    "2. Lemmatization: This process refers to doing things correctly with the use of vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, typically aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma.\n",
    "\n",
